# TextCNN-keras
This repo is a simple keras implementation of [**Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882.pdf), 
also you can watch more details in [**A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitioners' Guide to) Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.03820.pdf)).

## Requirements
To run the jupyter notebook, you need to install the following packages firstly.
+ gensim
+ numpy
+ keras
+ sklearn

## Reproduct the results in the original paper.
1.Download the pre-train word2vec [here](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/), and decompression the file to the root dir(./TextCNN-keras).<br>
2.Just open the jupyter notebook and run the cells in **TextCNN-keras.ipynb**.
